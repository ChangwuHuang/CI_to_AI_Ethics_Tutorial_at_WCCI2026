                <h2>Abstract and Learning Objectives</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics is a critical and rapidly evolving domain, with fairness and explainability
                    as its foundational pillars, alongside privacy, safety, and security. Many papers and books have been published
                    by researchers and practitioners from different communities, addressing different aspects of fair machine learning (FairML) and explainable AI (XAI). 
                    However, different work seems to focus on different definitions of fairness and explainability and propose different assessment criteria. 
                    As a result, a ML model may appear fair according to one assessment criterion but be simultaneously judged unfair 
                    according to another. Moreover, the notion of XAI itself remains contested and context-dependent, 
                    raising questions about what “explanation” means, for whom, and for what purpose. 
                    At the same time, AI functionality is now embedded in a broad range of systems, from general-purpose computing devices to embedded platforms and robots, 
                    as well as large-scale online services. These diverse deployment contexts raise distinct ethical and governance challenges 
                    that cut across technical, organizational, and regulatory dimensions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This tutorial provides a structured deep dive into these challenges. We will first offer a brief overview of AI ethics and governance, 
                    situating RAI (Responsible AI), ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) 
                    within a coherent and synergistic conceptual framework. Then, we will introduce the diverse definitions and measurement criteria 
                    for fairness in machine learning, explore multi-objective approaches to FairML, and highlight specific fairness concerns 
                    in modern systems like Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI in gaming. Subsequently, we will present a conceptual framework of AI transparency 
                    that clarifies the understanding and key elements of transparency. Building on this framework, we will articulate what explainability means to 
                    different people, at different times and for different purposes, how evolutionary multi-objective optimization could be used naturally 
                    to enhance explainability of machine learning models, and how XAI techniques can be used to enhance the performance of evolutionary algorithms
                     and neural networks. Finally, the tutorial will turn to AI ethics in embedded systems and robots, where constraints on computation, 
                     sensing, actuation, and autonomy raise distinctive ethical and governance challenges. The tutorial will conclude by synthesizing 
                     the interesting synergies between FairML, XAI, and evolutionary computation, suggesting directions for future research and practice in AI ethics and governance.
